#   Project Requirements Document: Student AI Assistant - Literature Review Feature

###   1. Introduction (Supplement)

This document details the requirements for adding a "Literature Review" feature to the Student AI Assistant. This feature will allow users to submit a query for a literature review, which will be processed by an AI agent to generate a report. The generated report will be displayed to the user within the application.

###   2. Goals and Objectives (Supplement)

* Introduce a dedicated section for generating literature reviews.
* Enable users to input a query specifying the desired literature review topic.
* Integrate with the existing `run_lit_review` routine to generate the literature review report.
* Display the generated report (in Markdown format) to the user.
* Provide user feedback during the report generation process (e.g., loading animation).

###   3. User Stories (Supplement)

* As a student, I want to be able to request a literature review on a specific topic.
* As a student, I want to provide a query to the system to define the scope of the literature review.
* As a student, I want to see the generated literature review report displayed in the application.
* As a student, I want to know when the system is processing my request and generating the report.

###   4. Functional Requirements (Supplement)

####   4.1. Literature Review Section

* **REQ-FUN-4.1.1:** A new section for "Literature Review" shall be added to the application.
* **REQ-FUN-4.1.2:** A link or icon for the Literature Review section shall be added to the foldable sidebar navigation. This link should be located under the "Research assistant" section.
* **REQ-FUN-4.1.3:** The endpoint for this section shall be “/research-assistant/”.

####   4.2. Literature Review Query Input

* **REQ-FUN-4.2.1:** Within the Literature Review section, the user shall be able to enter a query to specify the topic for the literature review. A text input field shall be provided for this purpose.
* **REQ-FUN-4.2.2:** The user shall be able to submit the query to initiate the literature review generation process.

####   4.3. Literature Review Generation and Display

* **REQ-FUN-4.3.1:** Upon user submission of the query, the application shall call the `run_lit_review` routine from "student-ai-assistant/agents/research_agent.py" with the user-provided query as input.
* **REQ-FUN-4.3.2:** The application shall display a loading animation or message to the user while the `run_lit_review` routine is executing and the report is being generated.
* **REQ-FUN-4.3.3:** Once the `run_lit_review` routine returns the path to the generated report (Markdown file), the application shall read the content of the report.
* **REQ-FUN-4.3.4:** The application shall display the content of the generated report in the Literature Review section. The Markdown formatting shall be rendered appropriately in the frontend.

###   5. Technical Requirements (Supplement)

* **TECH-REQ-5.1:** Implement new Flask routes and backend logic for the Literature Review section (at the “/research-assistant/” endpoint).
* **TECH-REQ-5.2:** Develop the backend logic to:
    * Receive the user's literature review query.
    * Call the `run_lit_review` routine.
    * Handle the returned report path.
    * Read the report content.
    * Pass the report content to the frontend.
* **TECH-REQ-5.3:** The frontend shall be able to:
    * Send the user's query to the backend.
    * Display a loading animation while waiting for the report.
    * Render the Markdown content of the report appropriately.
* **TECH-REQ-5.4:** Ensure proper error handling for the literature review generation process.

###   6. UI/UX Requirements (Supplement)

* **UI-UX-6.1:** Design a user-friendly interface for the Literature Review section, consistent with the overall Material Design theme using Tailwind CSS.
* **UI-UX-6.2:** Provide a clear input field for the literature review query.
* **UI-UX-6.3:** Include a clear visual indicator (e.g., loading animation, progress bar, or message) to inform the user that the literature review is being generated.
* **UI-UX-6.4:** Display the generated literature review report in a readable format, rendering the Markdown formatting appropriately.

###   7. Data Management (Supplement)

* **DATA-7.1:** This feature primarily involves processing data and displaying it to the user. Persistent storage of the generated reports is not explicitly required in this initial version, but could be considered for future enhancements (e.g., saving report history).

###   8. Future Considerations (Supplement)

* Allowing users to download the generated literature review report.
* Providing options for different report formats.
* Implementing a history of generated reports for each user.
* Adding functionality to allow users to provide feedback on the generated reports.
